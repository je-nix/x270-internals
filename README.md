Pictures of the Lenovo x270 internals

This pictures were taken during external flashing of my Lenovo x270 with an me_cleaner cleaned BIOS firmware. They are intended to give people who want to try similar things some information about chips and locations.

The BIOS chip is a Winbond 25Q128FV found on the top side of the system board (when you open the device), so there is acutally no need to remove the board from the case (like I did intentionally). Just open the device on the bottom side and remove the black plastic foil covering the board.

There is also a Winbond 25Q80BL SOIC on the rear side of the board which purpose I don't know.
